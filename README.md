### Welcome to the ###
# Kogswell Cycles #
## GitHub site ##

The goal of Kogswell Cycles is to involve cyclists
in the design of bicycle hardware that suits their needs.

We have found that the cycling community 
is comprised of people whose engineering and design skills
are substantial. By adopting open-source design methods 
we have organized those talents and used them 
to shape our products.

To meet our goal we rely on Github.
We share ideas and tools here.
