Welcome to the
# Kogswell Cycles #
GitHub site

    The goal of Kogswell has always been to offer cyclists 
    the chance to be involed in the creation 
    of bicycle hardware that suits their needs.

    To accomplish that we have employed the concepts 
    of open source design. Everyone is invited 
    to be involved in the creation of new cycling widgets 
    and in the refinement of existing ones.

    So we naturally find ourselves here at the nexus 
    of open source development, GitHub.
