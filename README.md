### Welcome to the ###
# Kogswell Cycles #
## GitHub site ##

The goal of Kogswell has always been to involve cyclists
in the design of bicycle hardware that suits their needs.

Over the years we have found that the cycling community 
is comprised of people whose engineering and design skills
are substantial. By adopting the concepts of open source design
we have organized those talents and used them 
to shape the products that we bring to market.

A central resource that we rely on to meet our goal is Github.
We share ideas and tools here.
